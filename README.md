# PyBer Ride Share Analysis  

## Overview of Project
Summarize ride share data for presentation to the CEO of PyBer. V.Isualize has a background in coding and likes to see multiple views of the data. The data needs to be analyzed by city type, urban, suburban and rural and further broken down into total drivers, rides and fares, average fare per rider and driver and total fare by city type. 

The PyBer Summary DataFrame provides a comparisson of PyBer's ridesharing services in three types of cities: rural, surburban, and urban cities. The summary shows that there is greater demand for PyBer among riders in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities. Between January 2019 and May 2019, there were 1,625 rides in urban cities, 625 rides in suburban cities, and 125 rides in rural cities. 


There were also a larger number of drivers in urban cities compared to suburban and rural cities. The figure below depicts the significance of drivers in urban cities during this time period.

Given that there is a greater usage of PyBer in urban cities, the total fares are higher. The figure below shows PyBer revenue distribution by city.

Rural cities have the highest average fare as there is likely a scarcity effect. 

The "Total Fare by City Type" chart shows trends of total fares in rural, suburban, and urban cities.


###Implications
PyBer should look to diversify their revenue stream from mainly urban areas, focusing on rural areas where the average fare is higher
PyBer should also look to recruit additional drivers for rural areas
Lastly, they should focus on increasing brand awareness in suburban and rural areas
